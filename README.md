# Filler-Free-Voyage
#Filler-Free Voyage is an interactive React.js-powered web application designed to enhance the viewing experience for One Piece fans #by providing a searchable filler-list engine.
  #Users can quickly determine whether an episode is canon or filler, streamlining their #watchlist. The platform includes a role-based authentication system, enabling administrators to manage episode classifications #dynamically through a CRUD-enabled admin dashboard. Built with React.js, Firebase, and REST APIs, the project demonstrates #expertise in frontend and backend integration, state management, user authentication, and responsive design.
